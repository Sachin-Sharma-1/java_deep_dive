**Java Special Features Implementation**

This repository contains my custom implementations and detailed explanations of various special features provided by Java. Each project demonstrates how to build or utilize core Java components, such as:

Dynamic Arrays: Implementation of ArrayLists to showcase dynamic resizing of arrays.
HashMaps: Custom implementation of hash-based data structures for efficient key-value mapping.
Stacks and Queues: Demonstrating the use and creation of LIFO and FIFO data structures.
Executor Service: Implementing concurrency mechanisms to handle asynchronous tasks and thread management.
The goal of this repository is to provide a deeper understanding of Java's powerful utilities by building them from scratch and exploring their underlying mechanics.
